# KMeans_Challenge
Coding Challenge

This coding challenge was given to me to implement a KMeans Clustering Algorithm similar to that in sklearn.

For comparison, I first wrote an example and a few graphs with a randomly generated dataset. Then, I attempted to create my own implementation of the KMeans algorithm with comparable results to that of the sklearn results. This assigment was to be completed within one hour.

Here is a plotted example of the sklearn clustering implementation:
